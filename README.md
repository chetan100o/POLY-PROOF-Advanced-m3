# ZK-SNARK-Assessment

This repository is for the project assessment of the project of the 3rd module of : POLY PROOF: Advanced course of Metacrafters academy . The purpose of creating this to prove my learning and to showcase my skill as a circom, solidity developer to the people.

## Problem Statement

Imagine that you wake up, check your email, and you see an interesting task: Polygon is asking you to design a new zkSNARK circuit that implements some logical operations. You need to implement the circuit and deploy a verifier on-chain to verify proofs generated from this circuit

For this project, you will create a circuit using the circom programming language that implements the following logical gate:

## Description
This program is a simple contract written in circom, solidity,  a programming language used for developing smart contracts on the blockchain. The contract has been created to verify the circuit using the different gates and verifing the output and deploying the contract created on the mumbai testnet which is the testnet for the polygon chain network and which uses MATIC as its currency for the gas fees.

### Install
`npm i`

### Compile
`npx hardhat circom` 
This will generate the **out** file with circuit intermediaries and geneate the **MultiplierVerifier.sol** contract

### Prove and Deploy
`npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts`
This script does 4 things  
1. Deploys the MultiplierVerifier.sol contract
2. Generates a proof from circuit intermediaries with `generateProof()`
3. Generates calldata with `generateCallData()`
4. Calls `verifyProof()` on the verifier contract with calldata

With two commands you can compile a ZKP, generate a proof, deploy a verifier, and verify the proof ðŸŽ‰

## Configuration
### Directory Structure
**circuits**
```
â”œâ”€â”€ multiplier
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ circuit.circom
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ input.json
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ out
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ circuit.wasm
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ multiplier.r1cs
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ multiplier.vkey
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ multiplier.zkey
â”œâ”€â”€ new-circuit
â””â”€â”€ powersOfTau28_hez_final_12.ptau
```
Each new circuit lives in it's own directory. At the top level of each circuit directory lives the circom circuit and input to the circuit.
The **out** directory will be autogenerated and store the compiled outputs, keys, and proofs. The Powers of Tau file comes from the Polygon Hermez ceremony, which saves time by not needing a new ceremony. 


**contracts**
```
contracts
â””â”€â”€ MultiplierVerifier.sol
```
Verifier contracts are autogenerated and prefixed by the circuit name, in this example **Multiplier**

## hardhat.config.ts
```
  circom: {
    // (optional) Base path for input files, defaults to `./circuits/`
    inputBasePath: "./circuits",
    // (required) The final ptau file, relative to inputBasePath, from a Phase 1 ceremony
    ptau: "powersOfTau28_hez_final_12.ptau",
    // (required) Each object in this array refers to a separate circuit
    circuits: JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(circuits))
  },
```
### circuits.config.json
circuits configuation is separated from hardhat.config.ts for **autogenerated** purposes (see next section)
```
[
  {
    "name": "multiplier",
    "protocol": "groth16",
    "circuit": "multiplier/circuit.circom",
    "input": "multiplier/input.json",
    "wasm": "multiplier/out/circuit.wasm",
    "zkey": "multiplier/out/multiplier.zkey",
    "vkey": "multiplier/out/multiplier.vkey",
    "r1cs": "multiplier/out/multiplier.r1cs",
    "beacon": "0102030405060708090a0b0c0d0e0f101112131415161718191a1b1c1d1e1f"
  }
]
```

**adding circuits**   
To add a new circuit, you can run the `newcircuit` hardhat task to autogenerate configuration and directories i.e  
```
npx hardhat newcircuit --name newcircuit
```

**determinism**
> When you recompile the same circuit using the groth16 protocol, even with no changes, this plugin will apply a new final beacon, changing all the zkey output files. This also causes your Verifier contracts to be updated.
> For development builds of groth16 circuits, we provide the --deterministic flag in order to use a NON-RANDOM and UNSECURE hardcoded entropy (0x000000 by default) which will allow you to more easily inspect and catch changes in your circuits. You can adjust this default beacon by setting the beacon property on a circuit's config in your hardhat.config.js file.
